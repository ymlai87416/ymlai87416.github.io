# Trade visualize

## Background

Currently, I am using Obsidian to log my trading, but it is very difficult to create graph to visualize my concept, so I build this tool to help me to do so.

## How to use

Very simple, load your trading to the app, and type in command to generate the stock graph on trading view

1. can mark the trade for you when you enter the trade

2. then you save the png

3. drag the png to the dropzone and I help you to convert the image to suitable format for me to store it in Obsidian

## Contribute
