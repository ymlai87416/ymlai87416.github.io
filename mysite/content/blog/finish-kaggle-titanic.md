A week has gone and finally, I have nailed this problem. 80% is not high, but it lands me on 4% which is OK for me.
 
The book Hands-On machine learning with scikit learn and Tensorflow really helps a lot in the process. It helps me to standardize what I have to do, so I donâ€™t need to think over when doing another ML project.
 
I have split my notebook into 3, and each focus on different area
 
Spend 80% of your time in engineering your features

Then spend you 5% of time choosing model

Then spend your cheap machine time to find a model which is good and not overfit.
