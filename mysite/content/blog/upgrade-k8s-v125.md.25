Finally I am able to touch my setup during Feb.

I take the chance to upgrade from 1.22 to 1.25, here are the notes

- Promox multi-node setup takes time. Don't know why the UI does not work
- Buy a shelf for your home lab is a must. It is not difficult, just go to IKEA
- when NFS is across network and too slow, NFS-provisioning simply does not work
- Don't really understand ZFS multi-node setup, may setup a lab for this
- ZFS on K8s is a new idea for me
- Does Intel NUC worth it, it does not have enough disk bays
- Can K8s provision ZFS directly from Promox, seems there are efforts in 
creating node (pass thru disk with Promox) across cluster.
- Running Grafana stack almost eating me 16G ram, may need to expla
