# Machine learning from Coursera by Andrew Ng


A very insightful course from Coursera and Udacity on Machine learning and deep learning using Tensorflow.
Learn some stunts which cannot be done by Programming 101.
 
Machine learning from Coursera:
 
A very good course in general, especially the assignment, really provide you a platform to test out whatever you have learnt from the video.
 
When I heard that I have to learn Octave, I thought “WOW, I have to learn again a new language”, but it turns out to be Matlab, which I have some experience before.

 

I am never a big fan of Matlab and R, so I translated all the assignment from Matlab (Octave) to Python for my reference, it turned out to be a great decision when I was studying deep learning from Udacity.
 
I encourage you if you have time to go through this course, even paying the cost of learning a new programming language… to understand what machine learning really are. If you really like to stick with Python, just take my code from my Github and put it into your personal arsenal.
Below are the assignments:
