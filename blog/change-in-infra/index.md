# Change in my personal infrastructure


### Setup K8S cluster for my use

K8S has outperform my expectation and work really well. I don't need to worry about dying computers anymore. 
If I think the project is OK and provide a stable income on it's own. I just simply migrate to Google cloud provider.

The setup involved 3 Raspberry PI (3 master in ARM) and 1 intel NUC (x86).

Now all my web service is hosted by K8S. e.g. my trade bot, my instragram bot.

### Try use Hugo to host my website

I duplicate my [original website](https://wwww.ymlai87416.com) to here.

Seems promising after I have tested out VuePress as my cheatsheet app.
