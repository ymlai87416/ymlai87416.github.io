    <description><![CDATA[Doing AWS Solution Architect Professional is like following road signs. It is intangible, it does not make you money, it does not teach you to make website. You just need to know enough to pass the exam and I advise you to take a breath first search approach to explore. The 5 domains are just nonsense. After reading them, you may ask yourself why you waste your precious life to do this.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I am a software engineer working in HK for 7 years, no much security background. I did work on machine code debugging to get what I want, you know when playing game and submitting homework assignment.
I know OSCP for long, when Kali was still named as BackTrack. I thought that getting OSCP was hard and somehow I was worrying if I can complete the whole course.
I have read BackTrack and play with Metasploit when I was studying Mphil.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Term 3, the final term is finished, and I want to share with you want I have learned in this term.
This term focuses on self-driving car brian:
Behavior Planning: Write a drive computer to drive, while collecting data and predict using what you have learned in Term 2 (e.g. EKF, UKF, particle filter, PID, etc…) Interlude: Lyft challenge on semantic segmentation Semantic Segmentation: To let the car know what these point clouds are, e.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Term 2 is finished, and I want to share with you want I have learned in this term.
This term focus on control, I learn how to use Kalman filter, particle filter, PID controller and MPC controller. This term requires C++ to finish but I have used it before.
In term 2, the course teaches you the followings:
Extended Kalman filter and Unscented Kalman filter When you have both lidar and radar and you want to extract the good from both of them, Kalman filter is the tool to use.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A friend of mine told me about this course, and I cannot believe that I can actually complete it.
 For the price, It worths me 49 USD only for 5 courses. The pricing model is $49/month until your finish the specialization. I finish the course within a month.
I can say it is a steal, for $49, you can have a taste of reproducing some good papers in the deep learning fields.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have recently finished the Udacity self-driving car course Term 1.
The course is great and out of my expectation. I joined the course because I want to consolidate my understanding of neural network an computer vision. The course does fulfill my wishes.
In term 1, the course teaches you the followings:
Use computer vision to find the road The driving computer needs to know where the road is in order to drive.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A week has gone and finally, I have nailed this problem. 80% is not high, but it lands me on 4% which is OK for me.
The book Hands-On machine learning with scikit learn and Tensorflow really helps a lot in the process. It helps me to standardize what I have to do, so I don’t need to think over when doing another ML project.
I have split my notebook into 3, and each focus on different area]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A very insightful course from Coursera and Udacity on Machine learning and deep learning using Tensorflow. Learn some stunts which cannot be done by Programming 101.
Machine learning from Coursera:
A very good course in general, especially the assignment, really provide you a platform to test out whatever you have learnt from the video.
When I heard that I have to learn Octave, I thought “WOW, I have to learn again a new language”, but it turns out to be Matlab, which I have some experience before.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Google hosts a Tensorflow course on Udacity, which is quite fun actually.
Tensorflow makes creating a neural network like a breeze. If you went through the course “Machine learning by Andrew Ng” before, you will wonder where should you put the derivatives of a objective function.
The answer is you don’t have to, Tensorflow computes the gradient numerically for you, you don’t have to differentiate any equations. Slow it is to compute gradient numerically, isn’t it?]]></description>
